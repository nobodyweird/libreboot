Look at ../../../docs/index.html under the "GRUB2 payload" section to see
how the files in ./original/ were generated.

The *.gkb files based off of them are generated by the Makefile at the
root of libreboot.

The files listed above are made available in the public domain (the information in them is public knowledge; copyright is pointless). Use them as you wish.
